**Horiseon Optimization**

    This is the Horiseon Optimized website.

    Fixed an issue with the search optimization link.

    Changed Lines in the HTML code to Better Represent their location on the page.

    The header tag has been changed to top-navigation, along with the corresponding css code lines.

    Changed div lines in the link section have been changed to nav, along with the corresponding css code lines.

    Changed additional lines from div to header and section lines for the main header and body.

    In the body section fixed the search optimization link line as is was missing the id= tag, and changed all div tags in this section to nav, to represent they are links to the top page.

    Changed further div tags to represent the Benefits side bar of images and text to aside tag, and condensed the corresponding css code to match this change.

    Changed the final div tags on the page to represent the footer, and any corresponding css code.
